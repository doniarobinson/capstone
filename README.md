# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Setup

The code for this project is contained in a Jupypter notebook and several supporting Python files. The only non-standard package used, and which may need to be installed via Pip, is seaborn.

## Datasets

The training set, test set, and sample submission file released by the competition are too large to be included in this repository. These files are available for download from my website at: goldstarwebs.com/capstone.zip
